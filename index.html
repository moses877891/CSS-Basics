    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
      <li>
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
        in other media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Css is not neccessary</span
        ><span class="bgColor">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control
        the layout of multiple web pages all at once
      </li>
      <li class="underLine">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>External - by using a link to an external CSS files.</li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However,<span class="bgColor">
          in this tutorial we will use inline and external styles,</span
        >
        because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it
        yourself
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style
      to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique
      element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
      directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements ona web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range range of selectors available. Two of the most
      commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which
      a style should be applied
